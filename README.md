# Simple Code
A solution for those who need a code editor but can't install anything on their machine and don't have internet access  
Uses codemirror (https://codemirror.net/5/) and wraps it in an interface with the new FileSystemAccess API  
Just download and open index.html to get started  
Use https://github.com/sean7601/compileJS to get down to a single .html file
